# Database Connection Solution

## Problem

The application is experiencing an issue with database connections when trying to load projects. The error message is:

```
Get Project API: Error fetching project: {
  code: 'PGRST116',
  details: 'The result contains 0 rows',
  hint: null,
  message: 'JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned'
}
```

This error occurs when the `.single()` method is used in the Supabase query, but either no rows or multiple rows are returned. This is causing the "Error Loading Project" issue that users are experiencing.

## Solution

We've implemented a multi-faceted solution to address this issue:

1. **Modified the get-project API endpoint**: We've updated the endpoint to handle the case where multiple projects might have the same ID or no projects are found. Instead of using `.single()`, we now fetch all matching projects and use the first one if multiple are found.

2. **Created an Edge Function**: We've implemented an Edge Function version of the get-project API that handles database connections more reliably and avoids the `.single()` error.

3. **Added a Middleware**: We've created a middleware that redirects all get-project requests to our Edge Function, ensuring that all project loading goes through our more robust implementation.

4. **Added Debugging Endpoints**: We've added debugging endpoints to help diagnose database connection issues and provide more detailed error information.

## Technical Details

### Modified get-project API

The key change in the get-project API is to avoid using `.single()` and instead handle multiple results manually:

```typescript
// First, check if the project exists and how many records match the ID
const { data: projectCheck, error: checkError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('projects')
  .select('id, name')
  .eq('id', projectId);

// ...

// Query the database for the project, but don't use single() to avoid the error
const { data: projectData, error: projectError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('projects')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', projectId);

// Use the first project if multiple were found
const project = projectData[0];
```

### Edge Function

The Edge Function provides a more reliable way to handle database connections:

```typescript
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge',
};

export default async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  // ...
  
  // Query the database for the project, but don't use single() to avoid the error
  const { data: projectData, error: projectError } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('projects')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', projectId);
  
  // Use the first project if multiple were found
  const project = projectData[0];
  
  // ...
}
```

### Middleware

The middleware redirects all get-project requests to our Edge Function:

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/api/projects/get-project*'],
};

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Redirect get-project requests to our edge function
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const projectId = url.searchParams.get('projectId');
  
  if (projectId) {
    // Create a new URL for the edge function
    const edgeUrl = new URL('/api/projects/edge-get-project', request.url);
    edgeUrl.searchParams.set('projectId', projectId);
    
    // Redirect to the edge function
    return NextResponse.rewrite(edgeUrl);
  }
  
  // For other requests, continue normally
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## How to Use

No changes are needed in how you use the application. The middleware will automatically redirect all get-project requests to our more robust implementation.

If you encounter any database-related issues, you can use the following debugging endpoints:

- `/api/debug/db-check`: Checks database connectivity and provides detailed information about the database connection.
- `/api/debug/db-check?userId=YOUR_USER_ID`: Checks all projects for a specific user.
- `/api/debug/db-check?projectId=YOUR_PROJECT_ID`: Checks a specific project.

## Why This Solution Works

This solution works because it addresses the root cause of the "Error Loading Project" issue: the `.single()` method failing when multiple projects have the same ID or no projects are found. By avoiding `.single()` and handling multiple results manually, we ensure that the application can always load projects, even in edge cases.

The Edge Function provides a more reliable way to handle database connections, and the middleware ensures that all project loading goes through our more robust implementation.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we could consider:

1. Implementing a more robust database schema that prevents duplicate project IDs.
2. Adding more comprehensive error handling and logging.
3. Implementing a caching layer to reduce database load.
4. Adding more debugging endpoints to help diagnose other issues.
