# ChromeBuilder Pro - AI Development Guide

## Project Overview
ChromeBuilder Pro is a web application enabling non-technical users to create, manage, and deploy Chrome Extensions through a conversational AI interface. The application provides an end-to-end solution from ideation to deployment, leveraging the Anthropic API for Claude 3.7 Sonnet to translate natural language descriptions into functional extension components.

## Technical Architecture

- Light and Dark theme toggle (dark theme default)
- Modern, clean, elegant design

### Backend
- Serverless functions for API processing
- Claude API integration via secure proxy
- Supabase for database and authentication
- File storage system for projects and templates
- Webhook support for deployment events

- Component files (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Deployment history and versions
- Collaboration settings

### Templates
- 5 Predefined project structures
- Sample code and configurations
- Categories and difficulty levels
- Usage statistics

### User Settings
- API keys and preferences
- Project defaults
- UI customization options
- Tutorial progress tracking

## Key User Flows

### Project Creation Flow
1. User greeted by AI-builder agent
2. User prompted for unique project name
3. Project created and saved to database
4. User prompted to select template or start blank
5. System generates basic extension structure
6. User customizes manifest settings (name, description, permissions)
7. AI helps generate initial components based on user description
8. User iteratively improves with AI assistance

### AI-Assisted Development
1. User describes desired functionality in natural language
2. AI generates appropriate code (popup UI, scripts, etc.)
3. User can request explanations or modifications
4. AI suggests optimizations and bug fixes
5. Generated code automatically integrates with extension structure
6. AI assists with Chrome Web Store upload requirements:
   - Store listing details (name, description, category, screenshots)
   - Privacy practices (permissions justification, data handling)

### Testing & Debugging
1. User activates simulation mode with "Test" button
2. System provides mocked Chrome API environment
3. User interacts with extension components in preview
4. System logs API calls and responses for debugging
5. Visual feedback shows functionality in action

### Deployment
1. User finalizes extension components
2. System validates extension and packages into ZIP with proper structure
3. User downloads package for manual upload to Chrome Web Store
4. System stores deployment version history
5. Optional direct publishing assistance workflow

## Build & Run Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm test -- -t "test name"` - Run specific test
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run db:migration` - Run Supabase migrations
- `npm run db:start` - Start Supabase locally
- `npm run db:stop` - Stop Supabase locally

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use 2 spaces for indentation
- **Types**: Use strict TypeScript typing, avoid `any` type
- **Imports**: Group imports (external â†’ internal), use path aliases (@/*)
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/interfaces/components
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch with specific error types
- **Components**: One component per file, export as default
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes with clsx/cva for variants
- **State Management**: Prefer hooks, use Zustand for global state

Always run linting and formatting before submitting changes.
