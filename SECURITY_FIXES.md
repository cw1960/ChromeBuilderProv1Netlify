# Security Fixes

This document tracks security vulnerabilities that have been identified and fixed in the Chrome Extension Builder project.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. CVE-2022-21211: Unhandled crash in npm posix package

**Date Fixed**: March 19, 2025

**Severity**: High (7.5/10)

**Vulnerability Description**:  
When invoking the toString method in the posix package, it will fallback to 0x0 value, as the value of toString is not invokable (not a function), and then crash with type-check. This affects all versions of the posix package.

**Impact**:  
This vulnerability could potentially cause the server to crash when certain operations are performed with the posix package, affecting availability of the application.

**Resolution**:  
- Completely removed the posix package from dependencies
- Replaced file handle limit adjustment code with native OS commands
- Implemented platform-specific checks for macOS and Linux systems
- Added better error handling and user guidance for manual limit adjustments

**Commit**: [cc0c64d](https://github.com/cw1960/ChromeBuilderProv1Netlify/commit/cc0c64d)

**Prevention**:  
- Use built-in Node.js modules and native OS commands instead of third-party packages when possible
- Regularly scan for security vulnerabilities using GitHub Dependabot
- Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions

## Dependency Updates

### 1. Update to Next.js 15.2.2 and related packages

**Date Updated**: March 19, 2025

**Packages Updated**:
- next: 14.2.24 → 15.2.2
- next-themes: 0.2.1 → 0.4.6
- eslint-config-next: 14.1.0 → 15.2.2

**Reason for Update**:  
These updates were recommended by GitHub Dependabot to address potential security vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility between the packages. Keeping dependencies updated helps maintain the security posture of the application.

**Commit**: [8d88bec](https://github.com/cw1960/ChromeBuilderProv1Netlify/commit/8d88bec)

**Benefits**:
- Security patches and bug fixes from newer versions
- Latest features and improvements in the Next.js framework
- Better compatibility with modern web standards
- Reduced technical debt by staying current with dependencies

## Security Best Practices

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
   - Remove unused dependencies to reduce the attack surface
   - Use trusted and well-maintained packages

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling to prevent crashes
   - Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
   - Log errors securely for debugging and monitoring

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks

4. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use role-based access control for authorization
   - Store credentials securely using encryption

5. **Code Scanning**:
   - Regularly scan code for security vulnerabilities
   - Use automated tools for static code analysis
   - Conduct security code reviews for critical components
